# Stochastic-Modeling-of-Interest-Rates-using-Cox-Ingersoll-Ross-CIR-model
This project involves the implementation and analysis of the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) model, a widely used stochastic differential equation model in financial mathematics. The CIR model is instrumental in describing the dynamics of interest rates and is utilized in the valuation of interest rate derivatives.
